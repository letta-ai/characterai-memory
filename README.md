# CharacterPlus: Build Character AI with Memory Using Letta

<img width="1103" alt="CharacterPlus Screenshot" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7977e40a-e0f3-4113-b4e6-d42c7543981c" />

## Overview

CharacterPlus is a **Character AI–style web application** that enables conversations with fully-fledged **stateful agents** powered by [Letta](https://docs.letta.com).

### Key Features
- **Persistent Memory**: Each character maintains long-term memory across conversations
- **Shared User Profile**: Characters share knowledge about you through a common memory block
- **Tool-Calling Capabilities**: Agents can perform actions beyond just chatting
- **REST API Integration**: Built-in endpoints compatible with Python and TypeScript/Node.js SDKs

> Built during the ["Stateful Agents Vibecoding" meetup](https://lu.ma/letta) using [Vercel v0](https://v0.dev).

## How It Works

### 1. Connect to Your Letta Server

Click the ⚙️ **Settings** icon and enter your [Letta Cloud API key](https://docs.letta.com/guides/cloud/letta-api-key).

**Using Self-Hosted Letta?**
- Replace `api.letta.com` in the source code with your server's IP address
- Use your server password as the API key (or a dummy value if not password-protected)

### 2. Customize Your Profile

Click the 👤 **Profile** icon to edit your `human` memory block. This [shared memory block](https://docs.letta.com/guides/agents/multi-agent-shared-memory) contains information about you that all characters can access.

**How Memory Works:**
- **Shared Memory**: When one character learns something about you, all characters receive that information
- **Private Memory**: Each character has their own persona and individual memories
- **Character Personas**: Pre-defined in [`/lib/characters.json`](/lib/characters.json)

### 3. Chat with Characters

**Character States:**
- **Active**: Agent exists and will resume previous conversations
- **New**: Agent will be created on first interaction

**Actions:**
- **Chat Now**: Start or resume a conversation
- **🔁 Reset**: Delete the character's memory and start fresh

### 4. Manage Characters in the ADE

View and manage your characters in the [Letta Agent Development Environment](https://app.letta.com):

Characters created by the app are prefixed with `character_*`.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Deploy on Vercel

1. Visit the [v0 project link](https://v0.dev/chat/characterplus-project-4d7WsE1OJeb)
2. Click "Deploy" to create your own live version
3. Share with friends or preview in the v0 window

### Option 2: Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd characterplus

# Install dependencies
pnpm install        # or yarn / npm

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your Letta Cloud API key to .env.local:
# LETTA_API_KEY=sk-ltta-...

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

## Production Considerations

### Authentication (Required for Production)

The current demo uses your personal Letta Cloud API key, which isn't suitable for multi-user applications. For production deployment, implement user authentication using Letta's **identity system**:

- Each end-user should have a unique identity
- Agents are associated with user identities, not your developer account
- Modify agent creation and listing API calls to include identity parameters
